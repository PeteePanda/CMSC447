<h2>Starting:</h2>
<p>The game starts off by introducing the game and how to play. Once the player confirms they are ready to play, they are prompted to input a username. If they choose to input a username it will be displayed on the leaderboard after each level, but if they choose not to input a username they will be given one. After both pop-ups are closed the player is able to play the game.</p>

<h2>Page Layout:</h2>
<p>They will see two main sections to the page. On the left is where the lyrics are, but some of the words are redacted, including the title.</p>

<p>On the right is a textbox where players can input their guesses one word at a time to reveal redacted lyrics to the song. If the word is already revealed within the lyrics, it will not be added to the guesses, else it will be added to the guesses and reveal the lyric if it was redacted.</p>

<h2>Leaving the Page:</h2>
<p>If the player decides to leave the page, their information will be stored with a cookie, that way when they come back they can pick up right where they left off.</p>

<h2>Guessing:</h2>
<p>When the player guesses the title of the song correctly all the lyrics will be revealed and the player will get the leaderboard of the top 5 players including what position they placed. The top 5 players are the ones who guessed the song's title with the least guesses.</p>
<p>If a player is unable to figure out what song it is, they have the option to press the Give Up button and move on to the next level without receiving a place on the leaderboard.</p>
<p>After the player has completed all 3 levels, easy, medium, and hard, they must wait until tomorrow to play again.</p>
