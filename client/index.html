                    Last night we let the liquor talk
                    I can't remember everything we said but we said it all
                    You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
                    But baby, baby somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet
                    No way it was our last night
                    <br><br>
                    I kiss your lips
                    Make you grip the sheets with your fingertips
                    Last bottle of Jack we split a fifth
                    Just talk about life goin' sip for sip
                    You, you know you love to fight
                    And I say shit I don't mean
                    But I'm still gon' wake up wantin' you and me
                    <br><br>
                    I know that last night we let the liquor talk
                    I can't remember everything we said but we said it all
                    You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
                    But baby, baby somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet
                    No way it was our last night
                    No way it was our last night
                    <br><br>
                    No way it was the last night that we break up
                    I see your tail lights in the dust
                    You call your momma, I call your bluff
                    In the middle of the night, pull it right back up
                    Yeah my, my friends say let her go
                    Your friends say what the hell
                    I wouldn't trade your kind of love for nothin' else
                    <br><br>
                    Oh baby, last night we let the liquor talk
                    I can't remember everything we said but we said it all
                    You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
                    But baby, baby somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet
                    <br><br>
                    No way it was our last night, we said we'd had enough
                    I can't remember everything we said but we said too much
                    I know you packed your shit and slammed the door right before you left
                    But baby, baby somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet
                    No way it was our last night
                    No way it was our last night
                    <br><br>
                    I know you said this time you really weren't coming back again
                    But baby, baby somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet
                    No way it was our last night
                    No way it was our last night
